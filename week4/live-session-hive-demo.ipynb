    "*The Apache Hive â„¢ data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. *\n",
    "\n",
    "2 key points to remember\n",
    "* the data is stored in \"regular\" files in hdfs, not in a relational database like postgres\n",
    "* the Hive program allows you to write SQL statements to query the data as if it was in a relational database\n",
    "\n",
    "### how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. in order to tell Hive that you want to treat a \"regular\" file like a database you have to make a mapping from the data to a SQL-like table\n",
    "2. when you execute a SQL command, Hive translates that into a map-reduce job to actually return the results\n",
